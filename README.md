# auv-slam-sim

ROS 2 Jazzy + Gazebo Harmonic simulation of a BlueROV2-style underwater vehicle with
sonar-based 3D SLAM (RTAB-Map), EKF localisation and 6-DOF thruster control.
Every node runs in its own Docker container.

> Work in progress. As of now only the base image and the container-to-container comms
> are in place. Vehicle model, simulator and SLAM nodes will be added one by one.

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop with Compose v2
- `make`

ROS 2 is not required on the host machine. All `ros2` commands are to be run inside the
containers only.

## Quick start

```bash
make build        # build the image
make smoke        # starts router + talker + listener and prints the listener output
```

If the comms is fine, the listener will print like this:

```
listener-1  | [INFO] [listener]: I heard: [Hello World: 4]
```

It means one container is receiving the messages published from the other container.

## Checking the comms

```bash
make ps                 # all three containers should be "Up", router should be "(healthy)"
make logs S=listener    # follow the listener logs, Ctrl+C to come out
make shell              # opens a ROS 2 shell in a new container on the same network
```

Inside the shell, usual ROS 2 commands will work:

```bash
ros2 node list              # /talker and /listener should be listed
ros2 topic list             # /chatter should be there
ros2 topic echo /chatter    # live messages, Ctrl+C to stop
ros2 topic hz /chatter      # around 1 Hz
exit
```

Once testing is done, stop the containers:

```bash
make smoke-down
```

## Make targets

| Target | Description |
|---|---|
| `make build` | build all the images |
| `make up` | start the stack in background |
| `make down` | stop and remove all containers |
| `make ps` | container status |
| `make logs` | follow logs, use `S=<service>` for one service |
| `make shell` | open a ROS 2 shell on the network |
| `make smoke` | talker and listener in separate containers, to check the comms |
| `make smoke-down` | stop the smoke test containers |

## Middleware

All containers are on the `auv_net` compose network and discover each other through the
Zenoh router container (`rmw_zenoh_cpp`). To switch to CycloneDDS, change
`RMW_IMPLEMENTATION` in `.env` to `rmw_cyclonedds_cpp`.
